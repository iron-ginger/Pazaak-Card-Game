# Pazaak-Card-Game
Text version of the card game found in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic

Written in Python by Lucas K

I first started this game in late 2017 to learn Python, and have since developed it into a full text-based game which (currently) runs in the console.

Long term plans include creating a GUI to run the game in, and using Django to create it as a web app.
