1) For further PEP8:
    -Redo and write docstrings for ALL functions
    -If a function argument's name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption

2) Create a reusable DRY function for the debug lines scattered throughout the code which take in the player objects and then run the appropriate debug functions as needed, rather than having a clunky check at the end of various parts. You do that with Data, so do it with Debug too.

3) Allow the sleep speed modifier to be modified with the settings as well, ex sleep[speed]/2 should just be sleep[speed] which takes into account that modifier when it is set. Also, reverse the speed settings order to actually be intuitive

4) Re-write rules to break down the core concepts in the game a little more concisely.

7) Improve comp behavior by programming multiple paradigms and allowing a
switch between them. I expect to see the computer players become more
difficult to beat by tweaking the chances to stay and play to create the
ideal weights for logical decision-makng.

8) Create the +1 -1 and tiebreaker cards

9) Create option for random comp opponent mode and maybe tournament mode with a persistent trophy option written to a DB with SQL

V. 1.1.1 - General Mod 1 (W.I.P.)
  6.11.2018
    - Modified names of the pazaak.py game method and sections.py loop to be more informative. Now, game is play, and loop is game.
    - Modified names of player and opponent within functions to be player and opponent, not ply and opp or pid and cid.
    - Modified Swap_order function to eliminate redundancy
    -Wrote function docstrings (except comp.py, options.py and opponents.py)

  6.9.2018
    - Changed the self.p and self.c init calls to be self.player_1 and self.player_2. Presently, self.player_1 will still be the only player to get a record attribute.
  
  6.6.2018
    - Changed how data is exported, which is now written in multiple lines, one for each player, two per game.
    - Changed the player/ computer player's 'main' attribute to be a True/ False switch, instead of a string, and modified internal calls to it as appropriate.
    - Changed state to normalize to None instead of a string variable.


**********************************************************

V. 1.1.0.5 - Breakfix for sections.py file
    - Changed the format of the loop function's data call to reset, which broke the game when it was changed.


**********************************************************

V. 1.1 - 6/3/2018 - 6/4/2018
